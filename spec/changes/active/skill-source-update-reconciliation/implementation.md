## Code Added

- `packages/shared/types/skill.ts`: added shared source update status, snapshot, stale target, and update check types.
- `packages/shared/utils/skill-source-update.ts`: added pure source update reconciliation helpers, shared `buildSkillSourceUpdateCheck()` snapshot builder for `B/L/R` classification, sync/async SHA-256 package fingerprinting, content-url snapshot helpers, legacy upgrade decision helper, and linked-local action policy.
- `packages/db/src/schema.ts`, `packages/db/src/init.ts`, `packages/db/src/skill.ts`: added and persisted source baseline columns for fresh installs and existing-user migrations.
- `packages/db/src/init.ts`: backfills existing non-empty `directory_fingerprint` rows with `fingerprint_algorithm = legacy-stable-text-v1` so upgraded users do not silently reinterpret old stable-text values as SHA-256 package fingerprints.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/skill-store-update.ts`: updated store checks to construct source snapshots and delegate status classification to the shared reconciliation builder while preserving legacy package-resource update detection.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/skill-source-resolver.ts`: added the source resolver adapter boundary for remote store, remote Git, remote zip, raw content URL, local-linked, and managed-copy source kinds; raw content URLs are normalized as single-file packages whose package fingerprint equals fetched content hash.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/stores/skill.store.ts`: writes source baseline fields during install/update/refresh, blocks linked local overwrite updates, records sanitized `source_last_error` for source check failures, materializes non-local remote source updates before metadata/baseline writes, passes optional AI safety scan config to remote package materialization, safety-scans raw content-url updates before writing, rolls back raw content-url writes on final DB failure, derives ClawHub package/content URLs from installed page URLs when the store entry is absent, and attaches project/agent copied target stale reports to source checks through `hasStaleTargets` / `staleTargets`.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer.ts` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/github-skill-store.ts`: tree/API registry scans no longer derive `directory_fingerprint` from Git blob hashes; those paths leave the package fingerprint empty until a clone/materialized package can be hashed with `skill-package-sha256-v1`.
- `packages/shared/utils/skill-identity.ts`: confirmed as the centralized ignore/fingerprint predicate used by desktop main, renderer, and CLI paths; it ignores local env/runtime/cache output while preserving distributable templates such as `.env.example`.
- `packages/core/src/cli/skill-cli-service.ts`: records `fingerprint_algorithm` for CLI package fingerprint writes, records installed baseline fields for source-backed CLI installs, and computes durable package fingerprints with the shared SHA-256 v1 package manifest utility.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-repo-sync.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/skill/local-repo-handlers.ts`, `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/skill/version-handlers.ts`, and `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer.ts`: record `fingerprint_algorithm` when main-process DB writes refresh package fingerprints and compute durable package fingerprints with the shared SHA-256 v1 package manifest utility.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-safety-scan.ts`: added deterministic preflight scanning reusable without AI configuration.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer.ts`: runs staged remote git/zip package preflight before copying into the managed repo; blocking findings leave the previous repo intact.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/services/skill-installer-repo.ts`: `saveToLocalRepoBySkillId()` now copies into a staging directory and swaps with a backup so partial copy or sidecar write failures preserve the previous managed repo.
- `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/skill/local-repo-handlers.ts` and `apps/desktop/src/preload/api/skill.ts`: allow optional staged package safety scan config for remote package saves.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/skill/SkillFullDetailPage.tsx` and `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/skill/SkillStoreDetail.tsx`: added user guidance for baseline-missing/source-unavailable/no-source and linked-local blocked updates.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/services/skill-source-update-reconciliation.test.ts`: added TDD coverage for the core status matrix, stale target auxiliary reporting, legacy upgrade decisions, linked-local blocking, SHA-256 package fingerprinting, and raw content-url snapshots.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/services/skill-source-resolver.test.ts`: added adapter classification coverage for remote zip, remote Git, raw content URL, local-linked, and managed-copy sources, plus the raw content-url stale directory fingerprint regression.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/services/github-skill-store.test.ts` and `apps/desktop/tests/unit/main/skill-installer.test.ts`: added regressions proving GitHub/Gitea tree/API scans do not expose legacy blob-hash manifests as package fingerprints.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/main/skill-source-update-db.test.ts`: added DB schema/migration/persistence coverage for source baseline fields.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/main/skill-installer-remote-git-package.test.ts`: added staged remote zip safety preflight rollback coverage and partial copy failure rollback coverage for managed repo replacement.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/stores/skill.store.test.ts`: added package baseline install/update/refresh, source-unavailable sanitized error recording, remote package and content-url update failure ordering, materialized content-url rollback on final DB failure, raw content-url safety-scan blocking before write, project/agent stale copied target auxiliary reporting, full source status integration matrix coverage, proof that source updates do not mutate copied project/agent scan snapshots, raw content-url single-file fingerprint normalization, and linked-local blocked update coverage.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/services/clawhub-store.ts`: added shared ClawHub page URL parsing and API URL derivation helpers so installed ClawHub page sources can resolve to package zip updates without Git clone.
- `apps/desktop/src/renderer/i18n/locales/*.json`: added localized keys for baseline-missing, source-unavailable, no-source, and linked-local blocked update guidance.
- `spec/knowledge/behavior/skills.md`: synced stable source update reconciliation rules for package baselines, status boundaries, linked-local protection, remote package apply ordering, raw content-url safety/rollback, and sanitized source errors.
- `spec/knowledge/reference/skill-regression-test-matrix.md`: added required regression rows for remote package update failure ordering, source-unavailable sanitized errors, downstream stale reporting, content-url durability, raw content-url fingerprint normalization, and SHA-256-labeled durable fingerprint writes.
- `apps/desktop/tests/unit/components/skill-full-detail-async-actions.test.tsx` and `apps/desktop/tests/unit/components/skill-store-remote.test.tsx`: added linked-local guidance UI coverage and source update status action coverage for `up-to-date`, `update-available`, `conflict`, `baseline-missing`, `source-unavailable`, and `no-source`.

## Current Findings

- Current Skill update detection already has the statuses `not-installed`, `up-to-date`, `update-available`, `local-modified`, and `conflict`.
- Current DB stores `directory_fingerprint` as the current local package fingerprint and `installed_content_hash` as entry content baseline.
- DB now stores `installed_directory_fingerprint`, `fingerprint_algorithm`, `source_last_checked_at`, `source_last_error`, and `source_binding_state`.
- Current `computeStableTextHash` is deterministic but not SHA-256. It remains a legacy identity helper for source ids, compatibility tests, and old-row comparison; durable package baselines labeled `skill-package-sha256-v1` use the shared v1 package manifest utility.
- Current ignore predicate already excludes `.env` and `.env.*` while preserving `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, and `.env.template`.

## Verification So Far

- Documentation-only review of current source paths and stable docs.
- Applied external design review decisions covering SHA-256 fingerprint migration, downstream stale decoupling, linked local overwrite blocking, `source-moved` deferral, baseline-missing UX, raw content URL fingerprint behavior, and safety scan timing.

- `pnpm --filter @prompthub/desktop typecheck`
- `git diff --check`
- Manual regression probe: `git ls-remote https://clawhub.ai/mineru-extract/mineru-document-extractor HEAD` still fails because the page URL redirects, while ClawHub `SKILL.md` and package zip API endpoints for `mineru-document-extractor` return HTTP 200; the updated source resolver now uses the package zip endpoint for ClawHub updates.

## Remaining Future Work

- A dedicated DB-backed source update service can still centralize renderer orchestration later, but v1 behavior now uses the shared reconciliation builder and persists the required baseline/error fields.
- UI presentation for project/agent downstream stale copy targets can be improved later; v1 intentionally exposes them as auxiliary `SkillSourceUpdateCheck` fields rather than as a source status.

## Review Decisions Applied

- v1 uses `skill-package-sha256-v1` for durable package fingerprints.
- Existing rows with missing `installed_directory_fingerprint` are silently upgraded only when legacy entry hashes prove local and remote match.
- A single `fingerprint_algorithm` field applies to both current and installed package fingerprints.
- `downstream-stale` is removed from `SkillSourceUpdateStatus` and exposed through distribution scan data or auxiliary `SkillSourceUpdateCheck` fields.
- `source-moved` is deferred from v1.
- Remote updates cannot directly overwrite `local-linked` external folders in v1.
- Raw `content-url` sources are treated as single-file packages.
- Safety scan runs after staging materialization and before atomic replace.

## Stable Docs To Sync After Implementation

- `spec/knowledge/behavior/skills.md` synced for v1 source update behavior.
- `spec/knowledge/reference/skill-regression-test-matrix.md` synced for v1 regression coverage.
- `spec/knowledge/structure/skill-system-design.md` synced for resolver and package fingerprint boundaries.
