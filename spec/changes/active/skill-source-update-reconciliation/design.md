# Design

## Overview

Skill source update reconciliation must become a shared domain workflow, not a UI-only helper.

The core model is:

```text
source identity -> resolve B/L/R -> classify state -> choose allowed action -> apply atomically -> refresh baselines
```

Where:

- `B` is the last known successful source baseline stored in DB.
- `L` is the current local My Skills package after syncing from the active package path.
- `R` is the current source package resolved from registry, remote Git, package URL, content URL, or explicit local source.

## `DES-SU-001` Source Identity Model

Source identity must be explicit and stable. Display names and slugs are not enough.

### Canonical Source Key

Use this normalized tuple to derive source identity when `source_id` is absent:

```text
source_type | source_url | source_branch | source_directory | canonical_skill_path
```

Normalization:

- trim whitespace
- convert path separators to `/`
- strip trailing `/`
- lowercase host and source type
- preserve case inside local paths only where the filesystem is case-sensitive
- normalize empty values to `""`

### Source Kinds

| Kind | Example | Update Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `remote-store` | official/custom marketplace entry | Resolve registry entry, then package/content source |
| `remote-git` | GitHub/Gitea/SSH repo with branch and directory | Clone or inspect tree, compute package fingerprint |
| `remote-zip` | release package URL | Download zip to temp, validate package |
| `content-url` | raw `SKILL.md` URL only | Treat as a single-file package; package fingerprint equals the normalized entry content hash |
| `local-linked` | external local folder import | Local folder is My Skills source; remote update only if explicit remote metadata also exists |
| `managed-copy` | PromptHub managed repo | Local managed repo is current package; source metadata decides whether remote exists |
| `project-scan` | project `.agents/skills` snapshot | Scan-only until imported |
| `agent-scan` | platform directory snapshot | Scan-only until imported |
| `backup-restore` | restored source metadata | Use restored metadata; no name collapse |

## `DES-SU-002` Source Origin Versus Install Mode

The update workflow applies to My Skills source packages only.

Project and agent install rows remain scan snapshots:

- symlink target may reflect My Skills changes automatically
- copied target does not update automatically
- external target is not owned by PromptHub
- built-in platform Skill is protected by platform metadata

After My Skills updates, project/agent copy targets can become stale. That status belongs to distribution scan, and is tracked separately from My Skills source update status.

## `DES-SU-003` Reconciliation Algorithm

### Inputs

```ts
interface SkillSourceSnapshot {
  contentHash?: string;
  directoryFingerprint?: string;
  version?: string;
  // Legacy is accepted only while upgrading existing rows; new durable snapshots use skill-package-sha256-v1.
  fingerprintAlgorithm: "skill-package-sha256-v1" | "legacy-stable-text-v1";
  resolvedAt: number;
}

interface SkillSourceReconciliationInput {
  skillId: string;
  sourceIdentity: string | null;
  baseline: SkillSourceSnapshot | null;
  local: SkillSourceSnapshot | null;
  remote: SkillSourceSnapshot | null;
}
```

### Comparison Rules

Use full package fingerprint when available:

```text
samePackage(A, B):
  if A.directoryFingerprint and B.directoryFingerprint:
    return A.directoryFingerprint == B.directoryFingerprint
  return A.contentHash == B.contentHash
```

Then:

```text
localModified = baseline exists and local exists and !samePackage(local, baseline)
remoteChanged = baseline exists and remote exists and !samePackage(remote, baseline)
```

### State Classification

| Baseline | Local | Remote | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | any | none | `no-source` or `source-unavailable` depending source metadata |
| none | L | R | `up-to-date` and initialize baseline if `L == R`; otherwise `baseline-missing` |
| B | L missing | any | `source-unavailable` for local path failure, with local error |
| B | L | R missing | `source-unavailable` |
| B | `L == B` | `R == B` | `up-to-date` |
| B | `L == B` | `R != B` | `update-available` |
| B | `L != B` | `R == B` | `local-modified` |
| B | `L != B` | `R != B` | `conflict` |

In v1, `source-moved` automatic lineage matching is deferred. If the resolved canonical source identity differs from the stored source identity, the check will return `baseline-missing` or require manual rebinding, preventing automated incorrect updates.

## `DES-SU-004` Package Baseline Data Model

Existing fields:

- `source_url`
- `source_id`
- `source_label`
- `source_branch`
- `source_directory`
- `canonical_skill_path`
- `local_repo_path`
- `directory_fingerprint`
- `content_url`
- `installed_content_hash`
- `installed_version`
- `installed_at`
- `updated_from_store_at`

Required additions:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `installed_directory_fingerprint` | `TEXT` | Last successful source package baseline |
| `fingerprint_algorithm` | `TEXT` | Single algorithm/version for both current and installed package fingerprints |
| `source_last_checked_at` | `INTEGER` | Last completed source check |
| `source_last_error` | `TEXT` | Last source check error summary, sanitized |
| `source_binding_state` | `TEXT` | `bound`, `detached`, `missing-baseline`, or null |

`fingerprint_algorithm` is intentionally a single field. The current package fingerprint and installed baseline must be recomputed together when upgrading from legacy data; v1 must not store mixed algorithms for `directory_fingerprint` and `installed_directory_fingerprint`.

Optional future column:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source_snapshot_json` | `TEXT` | Auditable structured snapshot for remote package metadata |

The first implementation should prefer explicit columns for query and migration clarity. `source_snapshot_json` is useful later for detailed diagnostics, but should not be the only durable source of truth.

## `DES-SU-005` Hash And Fingerprint Algorithm

### Naming

Use “fingerprint” in code and UI. Do not label durable hashes as MD5 unless the algorithm is actually MD5.

v1 algorithm:

```text
skill-package-sha256-v1
```

### Content Hash

For `SKILL.md` content hash:

1. Normalize line endings to `\n`.
2. Preserve body content.
3. Normalize frontmatter ordering only if existing behavior depends on it.
4. Trim trailing whitespace at end of file.
5. Compute SHA-256 over UTF-8 bytes.

### Package Fingerprint

For full package fingerprint:

1. Walk all files under package root.
2. Do not follow symlinks.
3. Represent a symlink as `symlink:<relativePath>:<linkTarget>` if symlink entries are allowed; otherwise exclude symlink entries and surface a safety finding.
4. Normalize relative paths to POSIX `/`.
5. Exclude entries through the shared ignore predicate.
6. For each included file:
   - text files: normalize line endings and trailing whitespace, then SHA-256
   - binary files: SHA-256 raw bytes
7. Sort entries by normalized path.
8. Build manifest lines:

```text
file:<relativePath>:<contentSha256>
symlink:<relativePath>:<target>
```

9. SHA-256 the manifest text.

For raw `content-url` sources, skip directory walking and wrap the normalized `SKILL.md` content hash as the package fingerprint. This keeps reconciliation generic while acknowledging that the package contains exactly one file.

### Legacy Fingerprints

Current `computeStableTextHash` returns a 64-character fallback hash but is not SHA-256. Treat those values as `legacy-stable-text-v1`.

Legacy migration strategy:

- If `installed_directory_fingerprint` is empty and `installed_content_hash` or the old local `SKILL.md` hash matches the resolved remote `SKILL.md` hash, background-initialize `installed_directory_fingerprint` and `directory_fingerprint` with `skill-package-sha256-v1`, update the single `fingerprint_algorithm` column to `skill-package-sha256-v1`, and keep the user flow silent.
- If the legacy entry hash does not match the resolved remote entry hash, return `baseline-missing` instead of silently choosing one side, and offer the user resolution choices to keep local as baseline, reset from source, or detach.

## `DES-SU-006` Ignore Rules

The existing `shouldIgnoreSkillDirectoryEntry()` behavior is the design baseline and should become the single shared predicate for desktop main, renderer, CLI, and tests.

### Must Ignore

- VCS: `.git/`
- PromptHub internals: `.prompthub/`
- dependencies: `node_modules/`
- Python caches: `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`
- JS/build caches: `.vitest/`, `.vite/`, `.parcel-cache/`, `.turbo/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `.svelte-kit/`
- coverage/cache/temp: `coverage/`, `.nyc_output/`, `.cache/`, `.tox/`, `.nox/`, `.tmp/`, `tmp/`, `temp/`
- virtual envs: `.venv/`, `venv/`
- package manager cache: `.npm/`, `.pnpm-store/`, `.yarn/cache/`
- generated files: `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`, `*.log`, `*.tmp`, `*.temp`, `*.pid`, `*.sock`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `Thumbs.db`, `desktop.ini`
- local env secrets: `.env`, `.env.*` except templates

### Must Include

- `.env.example`
- `.env.sample`
- `.env.template`
- hidden distributable files not explicitly ignored
- all package scripts/assets/docs/examples/reference files

### Negative Rule

Do not ignore every dotfile. Some dotfiles are distributable package behavior.

## `DES-SU-007` Status And UI Contract

The source update result should include enough detail for UI and tests:

```ts
type SkillSourceUpdateStatus =
  | "no-source"
  | "source-unavailable"
  | "baseline-missing"
  | "up-to-date"
  | "update-available"
  | "local-modified"
  | "conflict";

interface SkillSourceUpdateCheck {
  status: SkillSourceUpdateStatus;
  skillId: string;
  sourceIdentity?: string;
  local?: SkillSourceSnapshot;
  baseline?: SkillSourceSnapshot;
  remote?: SkillSourceSnapshot;
  localModified: boolean;
  remoteChanged: boolean;
  hasStaleTargets: boolean; // Auxiliary distribution signal; never changes source status.
  staleTargets?: Array<{
    targetType: "project" | "agent";
    targetId: string;
    installMode: "copy" | "symlink" | "external";
    currentFingerprint?: string;
    expectedFingerprint?: string;
  }>;
  error?: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    retryable: boolean;
  };
}
```

UI behavior:

- `no-source`: hide update button or show disabled “Local only”.
- `up-to-date`: show success state; no primary action.
- `update-available`: show primary “Update from source”.
- `local-modified`: show warning; primary action is not overwrite. Offer “Reset from source” behind confirmation.
- `conflict`: show danger/warning; require compare or explicit overwrite.
- `baseline-missing`: show setup decision dialog titled “无法确定修改历史 (Unable to reconcile history)”; description: “由于此技能是从旧版本升级而来，我们无法确认您是否对本地文件进行了修改。为了避免覆盖您可能做出的调整，请选择后续操作：”; actions: “保留本地修改并建立基准”, “重置为来源版本（覆盖本地）”, “解除与来源的绑定”.
- `source-unavailable`: show retry and source settings.

## `DES-SU-008` Linked Local Source Design

A linked local source has two possible layers:

```text
external local folder (required content source)
optional remote source metadata (only if user imported from or bound to a remote source)
```

Rules:

- The external folder is read directly for `L`.
- PromptHub never writes a managed copy unless the user converts import mode.
- If no remote metadata exists, source update check returns `no-source` after local sync.
- If remote metadata exists, remote check compares external local `L` against baseline `B` and remote `R`.
- **v1 Constraint**: To protect external files, PromptHub blocks direct remote update overwrites to external linked folders. The UI must prompt the user to convert to a PromptHub managed copy before applying the remote update, or instruct the user to manually pull/update the external folder in their editor or VCS tool. v1 must not write remote contents into the external path.

## `DES-SU-009` Safe Apply And Rollback

Source update apply sequence:

1. Resolve current skill and active package path.
2. Sync from local repo to DB to get accurate `L`.
3. Run reconciliation.
4. If status is not `update-available`, stop unless explicit force option matches status.
5. Create version snapshot containing current `SKILL.md` and file snapshot.
6. Resolve remote package into temp staging directory.
7. Validate staging:
   - one valid root `SKILL.md`
   - source identity matches expected source
   - path traversal blocked
   - package fingerprint computed
8. Run security/safety scans on the staged temp directory before writing into the final package path. If any high-severity vulnerability, malicious code pattern, or unauthorized command is detected, remove staging, leave the current package untouched, keep DB baseline unchanged, and return a blocking error.
9. Replace managed repo atomically:
   - write to temp under same parent when possible
   - rename old repo to backup path
   - rename staged repo to final path
   - remove backup after DB commit succeeds
10. Update DB:
   - content/instructions from staged `SKILL.md`
   - metadata from frontmatter/source
   - `directory_fingerprint`
   - `installed_content_hash`
   - `installed_directory_fingerprint`
   - `fingerprint_algorithm`
   - `installed_version`
   - `updated_from_store_at`
   - clear `source_last_error`
11. On failure:
   - restore old repo path if it was moved
   - leave DB baseline unchanged
   - record sanitized `source_last_error`

## `DES-SU-010` Resolution Actions

| Status | Allowed Actions |
| --- | --- |
| `no-source` | Edit locally, export, optionally bind source |
| `source-unavailable` | Retry, open source URL, edit source metadata |
| `baseline-missing` | Silently initialize baseline only when legacy hashes prove `L == R`; otherwise show “无法确定修改历史 (Unable to reconcile history)” and offer keep local as new baseline, reset from remote, or detach |
| `up-to-date` | Refresh metadata, open source |
| `update-available` | Update from source |
| `local-modified` | Keep local, create snapshot, reset from source with confirmation, detach from source |
| `conflict` | Compare versions, force source overwrite, keep local and detach, postpone |

## Affected Areas

### Data Model

- `packages/shared/types/skill.ts`: add fields and result types.
- `packages/db/src/schema.ts`: add new columns for fresh installs.
- `packages/db/src/init.ts`: add migration columns for existing users.
- Backup/restore services: preserve new source baseline fields.

### Shared Utilities

- `packages/shared/utils/skill-identity.ts`: upgrade fingerprint algorithm or add `sha256` variant while preserving legacy comparison.
- Ensure desktop main, renderer, CLI, and remote store adapters call the same ignore predicate.

### Desktop Main

- Add staging materialization and atomic replace helpers.
- Add IPC for structured source check/update if renderer-only implementation is insufficient.
- Ensure remote fetch/clone uses proxy/source validation policy and blocks path traversal.

### Renderer Store

- Replace `RegistrySkillUpdateCheck` with or wrap it in `SkillSourceUpdateCheck`.
- Stop using only `installed_content_hash` for package-capable sources.
- Add status-specific UI state and actions.

### UI

- Detail page update button becomes stateful.
- Conflict and local-modified states must not use the same primary affordance as update-available.
- Store cards and detail page must share the same source check selector.

### CLI

- CLI skill update/check commands should use the same reconciliation service after desktop implementation stabilizes.

## Migration Strategy

1. Add nullable columns.
2. Backfill `fingerprint_algorithm = legacy-stable-text-v1` for rows with existing `directory_fingerprint`.
3. Do not blindly copy `directory_fingerprint` into `installed_directory_fingerprint`.
4. On first source check:
   - if `installed_directory_fingerprint` is empty, compare legacy `installed_content_hash` or old local `SKILL.md` hash against resolved remote `SKILL.md` hash
   - if the legacy entry hashes match, compute local and remote package fingerprints with `skill-package-sha256-v1`, initialize both current and installed fields, and set `fingerprint_algorithm = skill-package-sha256-v1` silently
   - if the legacy entry hashes do not match, report `baseline-missing`
5. Preserve all old fields for compatibility.

## `DES-SU-011` ClawHub Page Adapter

ClawHub page URLs are registry identities, not Git remotes. The renderer parses
supported `clawhub.ai` page shapes into an owner and slug, then derives the
canonical `SKILL.md` content endpoint and package zip endpoint. Store-backed and
installed-source checks share these helpers so a missing store row cannot send
the page URL through Git package resolution.

## Verification Strategy

Required test layers:

- Shared unit tests for source identity, ignore rules, content hash, package fingerprint, legacy migration behavior.
- DB migration tests for new columns and backup/restore.
- Renderer store tests for all status matrix rows.
- Main-process filesystem tests for staging, atomic replace, rollback, path traversal, symlink behavior.
- Remote source tests for GitHub, Gitea, SSH Git, zip, raw content URL, unavailable source.
- UI component tests for detail button/badges/actions per status.
- Integration smoke for install -> local edit -> check -> conflict/update paths.

## Tradeoffs

### SHA-256 Instead Of MD5

MD5 is familiar as a phrase, but it is not appropriate as a durable identity contract. SHA-256 avoids collision concerns and can still be displayed as a short fingerprint in UI.

### Explicit Columns Instead Of JSON Only

Explicit columns make update queries, migrations, backup diff, and tests easier. A JSON snapshot can be added later for diagnostics.

### No Automatic Merge

Automatic three-way merge would be risky because Skill packages include scripts, assets, examples, and frontmatter. First implementation should block conflicts and require explicit user resolution.

### Do Not Infer Git Upstream For Linked Local Sources

Inferring upstream from arbitrary local folders can surprise users and create credential/network behavior they did not request. Explicit source metadata is safer.

## Design Conflicts And Decisions

- Current docs already require full package fingerprint and explicit ignore rules. This design reinforces that stable contract.
- Current code tracks current `directory_fingerprint` but lacks installed package baseline. This design records that as a required schema change rather than trying to infer from existing fields.
- Current `computeStableTextHash` is deterministic but not SHA-256. This design treats it as legacy and introduces algorithm versioning.
- `source-moved` is deferred from v1. Canonical source identity changes are handled as manual detach/rebind or `baseline-missing` until a future lineage design exists.
- `downstream-stale` is not a `SkillSourceUpdateStatus`; it is a distribution/topology signal exposed through auxiliary result fields and distribution scan rows.
