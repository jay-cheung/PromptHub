# Skill Regression Test Matrix

This matrix turns escaped user-reported skill bugs into required regression tests. It is a test-design contract, not a bug-fix plan.

For defect classification, start with `spec/knowledge/reference/skill-defect-taxonomy.md`. This matrix is the concrete regression layer after the bug has been typed.

## TDD Failure Pattern

The escaped bugs share these testing gaps:

- Tests asserted mocked API calls but not durable post-conditions.
- Tests covered `SKILL.md`-only fixtures but not full repo directory preservation.
- Tests covered install paths but not delete/uninstall cleanup paths.
- Tests validated detail views without checking that list, detail, project, and platform status use the same source of truth.
- Tests covered GitHub happy paths more than custom Git/Gitea paths.
- Tests did not include recursive file-browser behavior.
- Tests did not separate distributable Skill content from runtime/tooling cache
  files generated after install.

## Required Fixtures

Every future skill install/distribution regression suite should include:

- `full-repo-skill`: `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `docs/guide.md`, `scripts/setup.sh`, `assets/icon.png`
- `nested-file-skill`: at least two folder levels below the skill root
- `custom-gitea-source`: non-GitHub Git URL plus branch/directory metadata
- `same-name-variant`: two skills with same `name` but different `source_id`
- `copy-and-symlink-project`: one copied project skill and one symlinked project skill
- `runtime-cache-skill`: `SKILL.md`, `scripts/run.py`, generated
  `__pycache__/*.pyc`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`,
  front-end cache directories, coverage output, debug logs, and editor temp
  files

## Skill Lifecycle UI State Matrix

Skill lifecycle UI must be derived from stable identity and filesystem scan
metadata, not from display name alone. The shared identity order is:

1. scanned `localPath` matches library `local_repo_path` or `source_url`
2. scanned `symlinkTargetPath` matches library `local_repo_path` or `source_url`
3. scanned `directory_fingerprint` matches library `directory_fingerprint`
4. no match

`name` is display metadata only. Same-name Skills from different stores,
projects, agents, or folders must not be treated as the same managed Skill.

Directory fingerprints are package-content identities. They MUST ignore
runtime/tooling byproducts that users commonly create after install, including
Python bytecode caches (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`), Python analysis/test
caches (`.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `.tox/`, `.nox/`,
`.coverage*`), front-end/tool caches (`.cache/`, `.vite/`, `.vitest/`,
`.parcel-cache/`, `.turbo/`, `.next/`, `.nuxt/`, `.svelte-kit/`,
`.nyc_output/`, `.npm/`, `.pnpm-store/`, `.yarn/cache/`, `.sass-cache/`),
temporary directories (`tmp/`, `temp/`, `.tmp/`), debug logs, editor swap or
backup files, OS sidecar files, local environment secret files such as `.env`
and `.env.local`, virtual environments (`.venv/`, `venv/`), and runtime state
files such as `*.pid` and `*.sock`. They MUST still include distributable
template/config assets such as `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, and
`.env.template`. They MUST NOT ignore broad build output directories such as
`dist/` or `build/` unless a future requirement proves those directories are
never valid Skill assets.

### Completeness Boundary

This matrix is the required Skill lifecycle status contract. It is not a claim
that every theoretical filesystem, Git, DB, sync, and UI permutation has already
been exhaustively implemented and tested.

Rows in this matrix are complete only when all three conditions are true:

1. the source/origin is named;
2. the operation has a required state transition;
3. the user-visible label, action, and negative rule are documented and tested.

If a future Skill bug or feature touches a row that is not listed here, the row
must be added before implementation. If the row exists but lacks a test, the bug
fix must add the missing regression test before changing production code.

### Source Origin Matrix

PromptHub uses source origin to explain where a Skill came from. Source origin is
separate from install mode. Install mode says how a scanned folder is present in
a target directory. Source origin says where the managed Skill or scanned Skill
was obtained.

### Source x Operation Applicability Matrix

Legend:

- `Y`: operation applies to this source origin.
- `N`: operation does not apply by design.
- `D`: operation applies only after the source has been imported into My Skills.
- `S`: operation applies only when the source is scanned on a Project or Agent surface.
- `P`: operation applies only through a platform-specific adapter.

### White-Box Implementation Audit

Audit date: 2026-06-02.

Legend:

- `Implemented`: code path exists and matches the contract.
- `Tested`: at least one regression test asserts the user-visible or durable post-condition.
- `Partial`: code exists for the main path, but not every listed entry point or cross-surface path is proven.
- `Gap`: contract row is documented but missing implementation or regression coverage.

| Import scanned Skill to My Skills | Create/update managed Skill from scanned folder, then rescan/reload status so `Import` changes to `Open in My Skills`                  | Store/service test for durable repo import; component test for visible badge/action transition                              |
| Install My Skill to Project/Agent | Copy or symlink full Skill directory into selected target, then rescan and show `Copy install` or `Symlink install`                    | Filesystem/service test for full directory; component test for copy/symlink badges                                          |
| Remove from Project               | Delete only the project-local folder or symlink and refresh project scan                                                               | Filesystem/service test plus component test that project row disappears and My Skills source remains                        |
| Uninstall from Agent              | Delete only the platform-local folder/symlink and refresh agent scan; built-ins are blocked                                            | Main-process test for path/built-in guard plus component test for disabled built-in uninstall                               |
| Delete from My Skills             | Remove managed PromptHub repo/DB row; prompt about distributed copies/links according to copy/symlink mode                             | Service/UI test for copy preserve prompt, PromptHub symlink cleanup, and external symlink non-deletion                      |
| Refresh Store                     | Recompute remote entries with stable source identity and preserve Imported state                                                       | Source-id stability test with different clone roots plus component test for Imported after refresh                          |

| Install Git Package               | Clone/copy package, sync from repo, then set installed content hash from the synced `SKILL.md` baseline                                | Store test where repo sync returns content different from cached registry content                                           |
| Update Remote Package From Source | Snapshot current version, materialize remote package first, then update DB metadata and package baseline                               | Store regression where remote package materialization fails before any DB metadata/baseline update                          |
| Check Source Updates              | Return update state without mutating local content; source fetch failures become `source-unavailable` with sanitized error persistence | Store regression for source-unavailable plus component guidance tests                                                       |

### Shared Selector Rule

Project and Agent Skill list/detail/status surfaces must use the same selector
or pure helper for:

- matching scanned Skills to My Skills;
- deciding whether an install is external;
- deciding the copy/symlink/external/built-in badge;
- deciding whether `Import to My Skills` or `Open in My Skills` is visible.

Component-local forks of this logic are regression risks and require a matrix
test before they are allowed.

## Package Boundary Test Rule

For any path named import, install, sync, export, distribute, or deploy, the test fixture must be a Skill directory, not a bare `SKILL.md` file. A single-file Skill fixture is allowed only when the test explicitly verifies the single-file compatibility case, and the expected result must still be a directory containing `SKILL.md`.

The minimum file-inventory assertion for package fidelity is:

```text
SKILL.md
docs/guide.md
scripts/setup.sh
assets/icon.png
```

The test must compare relative paths in the managed repo after the operation. Asserting `writeLocalFile("SKILL.md")` or `saveToRepo` was called is not sufficient.

## Coverage and Harness Rule

Skill package-boundary changes require 100% line, function, branch, and condition coverage for new or changed production code. The harness must include:

- black-box filesystem assertions against the managed repo inventory
- white-box branch coverage for GitHub raw-content vs custom Git/Gitea clone-backed paths
- IPC validation for malformed inputs and missing skills
- failure/rollback coverage for clone, copy, sync, and persistence errors
- adversarial path coverage for `../`, absolute paths, hidden internal directories, symlinks, and missing `SKILL.md`
- stress coverage for large package inventories

If a legacy file cannot reach 100% overall in one change, the active change must list the unrelated uncovered branches and still prove every new/changed branch and condition.

## Test Acceptance Rules

A test item from this matrix is not complete until it asserts the user-visible post-condition:

- persisted DB row or status field when persistence is involved
- actual managed repo files when import/copy/symlink is involved
- platform filesystem state when platform install/uninstall is involved
- rendered list/detail/project/store state when UI status is involved
- no stale status after reload or rescan when derived state is involved

Mock call counts alone do not satisfy this matrix.
